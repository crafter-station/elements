## Overview

A compound component for visualizing how messages are routed to specific agents in multi-agent systems. Shows the input message with pattern matching highlights, the matched routing rule, and the target agent with confidence scores. Supports animated states during active routing decisions.

## Installation

```bash
bunx shadcn@latest add @elements/routing-indicator
```

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  RoutingIndicator,
  RoutingIndicatorHeader,
  RoutingIndicatorContent,
  RoutingMatch,
} from "@/components/elements/ai-elements/multi-agent/routing-indicator";

export function RoutingIndicatorExample() {
  return (
    <RoutingIndicator
      input="Can you help me search for information about React hooks?"
      matchedPattern="search"
      targetAgent="Research Agent"
      confidence={0.92}
      isRouting={false}
    />
  );
}

export function ActiveRoutingExample() {
  return (
    <RoutingIndicator
      input="Help me write a Python function"
