## Overview

A compound component for visualizing the sequence of agent handoffs in multi-agent workflows. Displays a breadcrumb-style chain showing which agents have handled a request, with arrows between transitions and the ability to click nodes to see handoff details and reasons.

## Installation

```bash
bunx shadcn@latest add @elements/handoff-chain
```

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  HandoffChain,
  HandoffChainDetail,
  HandoffChainTimeline,
} from "@/components/elements/ai-elements/multi-agent/handoff-chain";

const handoffs = [
  {
    id: "1",
    fromAgent: "Router",
    toAgent: "Research Agent",
    reason: "Query requires web search",
    timestamp: new Date(),
    isActive: false,
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    fromAgent: "Research Agent",
    toAgent: "Writer Agent",
    reason: "Data collected, ready to compose",
    timestamp: new Date(),
    isActive: true,
  },
];

export function HandoffChainExample() {
  return (
    <HandoffChain
      handoffs={handoffs}
      onSelect={(handoff) => console.log("Selected:", handoff)}
    >
      <HandoffChainDetail />
