## Overview

A compound component for comparing system prompts with side-by-side or unified diff views. Shows added/removed line highlighting, line numbers, and copy buttons. Essential for prompt engineering, A/B testing, and version tracking in AI applications.

## Installation

```bash
bunx shadcn@latest add @elements/prompt-diff
```

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  PromptDiff,
  PromptDiffHeader,
  PromptDiffViewToggle,
  PromptDiffContent,
  PromptDiffCopyButton,
} from "@/components/elements/ai-elements/devtools/prompt-diff";

export function PromptDiffExample() {
  const oldPrompt = "You are a helpful assistant.";
  const newPrompt = "You are a helpful AI assistant.\nBe concise.";

  return (
    <PromptDiff oldText={oldPrompt} newText={newPrompt}>
      <PromptDiffHeader>
        <PromptDiffViewToggle />
        <PromptDiffCopyButton />
      </PromptDiffHeader>
      <PromptDiffContent />
    </PromptDiff>
  );
}
```
