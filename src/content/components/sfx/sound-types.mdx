## Overview

Core type definitions for the SFX sound system. Installed automatically as a dependency when you add any sound.

## Installation

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @elements/sound-types
```

Typically you don't need to install this directly - it's pulled in automatically by any `sfx-*` component.

## Types

### SoundAsset

The main type representing a sound file with inline base64 audio data.

```tsx
interface SoundAsset {
  name: string;
  dataUri: string;
  duration: number;
  format: "mp3";
  license: "CC0";
  author: string;
}
```

### UseSoundOptions

Options for the `useSound` hook.

```tsx
interface UseSoundOptions {
  volume?: number;
  playbackRate?: number;
  interrupt?: boolean;
  onEnd?: () => void;
}
```

### UseSoundReturn

Return type of the `useSound` hook.

```tsx
type UseSoundReturn = [
  PlayFunction,
  {
    stop: () => void;
    pause: () => void;
    isPlaying: boolean;
    duration: number;
    sound: SoundAsset;
  },
];
```
