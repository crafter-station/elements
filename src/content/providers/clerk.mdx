## Clerk Elements (Official - Beta)

We're waiting for [Clerk Elements](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/elements/overview) to stabilize before providing our own custom sign-in/sign-up implementations.

### Why the wait?

Clerk Elements is Clerk's official library for building custom authentication UIs. It's currently in **beta** and not yet recommended for production use. Once it's stable, we'll provide fully customized, production-ready components built on top of Clerk Elements.

### What is Clerk Elements?

Clerk Elements is a library of **unstyled, composable components** that let you build custom UIs on top of Clerk APIs without managing the underlying authentication logic.

**Key features:**
- Component-first approach for easy custom UI development
- Unstyled components with built-in accessibility
- Full control over styling and layout
- Works with Tailwind CSS and existing component libraries
- Support for sign-in and sign-up flows (more coming soon)

### Getting started with Clerk Elements

Currently supports **Next.js App Router** only. More framework support coming soon.

#### 1. Install Clerk Elements

```bash
npm install @clerk/elements
```

> Make sure your `tsconfig.json` has `moduleResolution` set to `bundler` for TypeScript support.

#### 2. Build custom flows

Explore Clerk's official guides:
- [Build a sign-in flow](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/elements/guides/sign-in)
- [Sign-in examples](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/elements/examples/sign-in)
- [Sign-in components reference](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/elements/reference/sign-in)

### In the meantime

While Clerk Elements is in beta, you can use:

1. **Clerk's prebuilt components** - Fast setup with the `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` components
2. **Custom implementations** - Build your own with Clerk's hooks and APIs
3. **Appearance customization** - Use the [appearance prop](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/overview) for styling prebuilt components
