## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18.0 or later
- npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun package manager

## Installation

### Initialize Your Project

If you're starting a new project, you can use our CLI to set up everything:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
```

### Add Elements

Install the Elements CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

This will set up your project with the necessary configuration files.

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have the following structure:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── page.tsx
├── components/
│   └── ui/
├── lib/
│   └── utils.ts
└── package.json
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have Elements set up, you can:

1. Browse the component library
2. Add components to your project
3. Customize the theme
4. Build your application
